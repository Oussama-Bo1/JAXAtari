% \title{Introduction}
Dear JaxAtari Lab Team,

We are a group of three Master's students in Information Systems at TU Darmstadt, and we would like to express our strong interest in participating in the Practical Lab in AI.

Our motivation stems from both a deep interest in reinforcement learning (RL) and hands-on experience in implementing and extending AI-based environments. As part of this lab , we aim to contribute a visual enhancement to the skiing environment by extending the player's avatar: When steering left or right, the skier will visibly lean in the corresponding direction. This meaningful visual enhancement increases the experience of the gameplay and makes the environment more intuitive and appealing for further RL research or user studies. Furthermore, we made sure that the game resets once the player hits an obstacle while skiing downward. 

We have already successfully run the JaxAtari environment locally, understood its structure, and started implementing the skier lean feature by dynamically linking the steering logic to directional sprites. Our team combines programming experience in JAX and Pygame with a strong interest in modular design and usability.

We are excited about contributing to a modern, collaborative, and open-source reinforcement learning platform and are committed to delivering clean and well-documented code.

We would be thrilled to join the lab and contribute to this exciting project.

Kind regards,
Niklas Weber, Steven Mkhitarian, Oussama Bourhalem}
